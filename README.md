### NoSQL_setup.ipynb
Contains the mongoimport code ran to import the data set located in the Resources directory. Updates the dataset to contain a new restaurant. Removes all locations in Dover. Converts several fields to the correct data type

### NoSQL_analysis.ipynb
Contains several exploratory analyses of the data set up in NoSQL_setup.ipynb. There are several specific matches, groups, and sorts with each being converted to a pandas DataFrame and displayed using prettyprint

All code is my original work.
